# Portfolio Exposure Risk Summary Generator

> n8n + Google Sheets + Gemini + Slack + Gmail

---

This workflow automatically analyzes portfolio data from Google Sheets on a scheduled basis, calculates exposure metrics such as sector allocation and concentration and generates a professional risk summary using Google Gemini. The report is then sent via email, shared on Slack and logged for historical tracking.

### Quick Implementation Steps

- Connect your Google Sheets portfolio data
- Add Gemini API credentials
- Configure Gmail and Slack nodes
- Set schedule trigger timing
- [Run once to verify output and logging](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi)

## What It Does

This workflow performs a complete portfolio risk analysis pipeline. It starts by fetching portfolio data from a Google Sheet and validating whether the required data exists. If valid data is present, it calculates key exposure metrics such as total portfolio value, sector allocation and concentration levels using a Code node.

These calculated metrics are then passed to an AI model (Google Gemini), which generates a concise and professional risk summary. The workflow ensures the output is structured properly before preparing a final report.

The final output is distributed through multiple channels: an email report, a Slack notification and a log entry in Google Sheets. If no portfolio data is available, the workflow gracefully handles the scenario by generating a fallback report and logging it.

## Who It's For

- Financial analysts monitoring portfolio risk
- Investment advisors managing client portfolios
- Business owners tracking asset exposure
- Automation enthusiasts building financial workflows

## Requirements to Use This Workflow

- [n8n account (cloud or self-hosted)](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi)
- Google Sheets with portfolio data
- Google Gemini API credentials
- Gmail account connected in n8n
- Slack workspace connected in n8n

## How It Works & Setup Guide

### Step 1: Schedule Trigger

- Configure the **"Schedule Risk Review"** node
- Default: Weekly run (Monday at 9 AM)

### Step 2: Connect Portfolio Data

- Use **"Read Portfolio From Sheet"** node

- Ensure sheet contains columns like:
  - Asset Name
  - Sector
  - Quantity
  - Price
  - Market Value (optional)

### Step 3: Validate Data

- **"Check Portfolio Data Exists"** ensures valid entries exist
- If no data → fallback branch executes

### Step 4: Calculate Exposure Metrics

- Code node calculates:
  - Total portfolio value
  - Sector exposure and percentages
  - Top holding concentration
  - Top 3 holdings

### Step 5: Generate AI Risk Summary

- **"Generate Risk Summary"** uses Gemini model
- Input includes calculated metrics
- Output is structured JSON with risk summary

### Step 6: Parse AI Output

- **"Parse Risk Summary"** ensures valid JSON output
- Handles fallback parsing if needed

### Step 7: Prepare Final Report

- **"Prepare Risk Report Data"** formats final fields:
  - Total value
  - Top sector and exposure
  - Top holding and concentration
  - Risk summary
  - Run date and ID

### Step 8: Deliver Report

- Email sent via Gmail node
- Slack message posted
- Data logged in Google Sheets

### Step 9: Fallback Handling

- If no portfolio data exists:
  - Default summary is generated
  - Logged to sheet for consistency

## How To Customize Nodes

- Modify schedule timing in Schedule node
- Update Google Sheet structure as per your data
- Adjust Code node logic for additional metrics
- Customize AI prompt for different analysis styles
- Change email/Slack message formatting

## Add-ons

- Add risk scoring system (low/medium/high)
- Integrate historical trend analysis
- Add client-specific reporting
- Include asset-level risk breakdown
- Connect dashboards (e.g., Google Data Studio)

## Use Case Examples

- Weekly portfolio risk monitoring
- Client portfolio reporting for advisors
- Internal investment review automation
- Risk alerts for concentrated holdings
- Portfolio diversification analysis

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| No data processed | Empty Google Sheet | Ensure portfolio data exists |
| AI output not parsed | Invalid JSON response | Check prompt format or parsing node |
| Email not sent | Gmail credentials missing | Reconnect Gmail account |
